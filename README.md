## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings
- **Goal**: Predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant using ML regression models.
- **Approach**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
  - Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree
  - Performance evaluation using MSE and R² score
  - Feature importance analysis

### 🔹 Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
- **Goal**: Recommend restaurants based on user preferences.
- **Approach**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Content-based filtering method
  - Sample user preference scenarios
  - Evaluation of recommendation quality

### 🔹 Task 3: Cuisine Classification
- **Goal**: Classify restaurants based on their cuisine types.
- **Approach**:
  - Data preparation and encoding
  - Classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
  - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall
  - Bias and performance analysis
